# Takeaways  


* Recent growth in online learning communities for data science mediated by social networking apps 
(Twitter, Slack)
* Context for [#TidyTuesday on Twitter](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
  + [R](https://cran.r-project.org) open-source statistical software  
  + [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) packages for data management and visualization  
  + [R for Data Science](https://www.rfordatasci.com) book and organization  
  
* How accessible are TidyTuesday tweets for people who are blind or have low vision?  
  + Alt-text is a method for providing text descriptions of images on Twitter, in HTML, and in other applications that can be read by screen reading software  
  + Five essential features of alt-texts  
  
  


---
name: motivation
class: highlight-last-item <!--css class that makes the "current" bullet point bold and the previous points gray-->

# Motivation

* Can blind people participate in online data science learning communities? #TidyTuesday as 
an example  
	+ Are participants using alt-text to describe their images?  
    + Do these descriptions provide enough information for the reader to understand the graphic?  
	

* Screen reader basics:  
  + Provides voice or braille access to computer **text** (OS interactions, email, web browsing, 
  some IDEs, etc.)  
  + **Cannot** describe images  

* AI image description  
  + Available on iOS, OSX, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
  + **Cannot** adequately describe data visualizations  
	

* Why include screen reader users?  
  + Access to information examples  
	+ Regional COVID-19 incidence information  
	+ Election maps  
	+ Scientific literature    
  + Blind researchers need to  
	+ Elicit good descriptions from colleagues, so knowing what kinds of graphs are possible is important
	+ Continue learning about advances in data visualization  
	+ Create data visualizations for reports and publications  
	  

* Alt- text is a text description of a graphic that conveys its meaning to screen reading software


---
name: TidyTuesday

# What is TidyTuesday?  

* Data set information is tweeted on Mondays  
* Participants explore the data, format it according to use with data cleaning, analysis, and 
visualization packages that are part of the Tidyverse group of R packages  
	+ Data visualizations can focus on any part of the data, or replicate the visualization 
	from the original post  
	+ Emphasis is on data organization and visualization, not interpretation

* TidyTuesday tweets include  
	+ A verbal description, often including the author's particular interest in the data 
	or new methods they learned  
	+ A link to the author's code for producing the visualization is encouraged
	+ The image itself
	+ An alt-text describing the image (guidance to participants on this is recently available)
	  
<!-- on Twitter, Thomas Mock said he had changed the TidyTuesday readme (presumably on GitHub) to 
include information about alt-text, but I just checked and it's not listed as part of the process 
I would have linked it here. -->
		
* Feedback from the community is supposed to be positive in line with TidyTuesday's aim to be "safe and supportive"

# TidyTuesday data collection  

- How is TidyTuesday data collected? 

---
name: analysisAltText

# Alt text scraping

- How was alt text scraped from the images?

???

---
name: analysisResultsIncidence

# What did we find? 

Over four years (2018-2021), there were 6443 tweets with the TidyTuesday hashtag. Alt-texts were 
attached to 2.4% of these Tweets.  

``` {r, Alt-text incidence, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
years <- c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)
pct <- c(1.1, 1.0, 2.9, 7.7)
tab1 <- data.frame(years, pct)
colnames(tab1) <-c("Year", "TidyTuesday Tweets Containing Alt-text")
kable(tab1, row.names=FALSE, caption="Percentage of TidyTuesday Tweets Containing alt-text by Year")

```

# How extensive are the alt-texts?

``` {r, Alt-Text lengths, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
words  <- c(18, 1, 170)
characters <- c(93, 8, 788)
tab2 <- data.frame(rbind(words, characters))
colnames(tab2) <- c("Median", "Minimum", "Maximum")
rownames(tab2) <- c("Words", "Characters")
kable(tab2, caption="Alt-text Lengths in Words and Characters")
```

# Use of alt text has increased over time

name: analysisResultsRubric

* Five characteristics of visualization alt-text based on personal experience and reading the scraped alt-texts  

  1. A description of what can be seen about the data (relationships between 
  x and y variables, histogram shape, appearance of points in residual plots)  
  2. What variables are on the axes?  
  3. What scale are the axes on, or is the scale described within the overall description?  
  4. What type of plot is it (line graph, scatterplot, qq plot, etc)  
  5. Alt-text should contain more information than title and/or subtitle of the plot
    
* After removing duplicate tweets and tweets that did not contain data visualizations, there were 196 tweets with alt-text.  

``` {r, rubric table, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
meaning <- c(1, "Conveys Meaning", 34)
axis1 <- c(2, "Axis Variables", 28)
axis2 <- c(3, "Axis Scale", 12)
plotType <- c(4, "Plot Type", 56)
repeatTitle <-c(5, "Repeats Title", 9)
tab3 <- data.frame(rbind(meaning, axis1, axis2, plotType, repeatTitle))
colnames(tab3) <- c("Characteristic", "Description", "Percent of Alt-texts containing this feature")
kable(tab3, row.names=FALSE, caption="Percentages of Alt-texts Containing Five Types of Information")

```

- Conclusion: Many alt-texts are missing information

* Limitations: One person with many years' experience analyzing data in R identified 
these features based on that experience and the TidyTuesday data set, without visual access 
to the data.

# Where else does this show up?  

* Online R books made available digitally to people with print disabilities by [Bookshare](https://www.bookshare.org/cms/)   

* R package documentation (e.g. HTML help for gtsummary::tbl_summary has example output as .png files with no description)  

* Blogs  

* This shows up at the individual-level and at the corporate-level (e.g. RStudio rmarkdown documentation)

# Has the tide started shifting?

- Where are conversations about this happening
  - Within R: useR!2021, MiR
  - More broadly: Data Visualization Society, a11y Meetups
- What changes have we seen generally (e.g. new alt text code chunk option for R Markdown)?
- What changes have we noticed since announcing our talk?
- Changes are just starting and slow

???
Caveats relating to required behavioral changes. For example: The alt-text thing for R Markdown is great, *but*  people will probably have to interrupt their workflow to describe what the data show after creating the graphic! If you want reproducible reports, you will still have to go back in and explain what the data show. This is why people are going to be tempted to put just the title-caption there and leave out the most crucial information.

name: goodAltText

# How to write good alt text for a data visualization

Include these four things:  
1. What kind of plot is it? (line graph, scatterplot, residual plot)  
   + Describe it further if it's a specialized type of plot  
2. What variables are on the axes?  
3. What is the range or scale of the variables?  
4. What do you see about the relationship between the variables in the plot?  
	

Ask yourself
* Do you have enough information to understand the purpose of the image without seeing it?  
* Is your alt-text a repetition of the title or does it tell me something about the data as well?

name: learningResources

# Where can people learn more?

* Make your data visualizations accessible everywhere you can by adding alt-text to websites, journalism, scientific publishing, social media  

* Find ways to describe your visualizations in words when alt-text isn't available in your documents or platforms  




Data visualization alt-text resources:  

*	[Writing alt-text for data visualization](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)

* There is information about adding alt-text to rmarkdown documents in 
[Chapter 14 of the R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-accessibility.html).
